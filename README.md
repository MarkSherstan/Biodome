# Biodome
Sensor suite and webpage interface for monitoring plants around the house. Inspired by the Cloud Forest in Singapore.

## Ideas
- Website JavaScript interface (similar to Octo-Print)
- Each plant have its own tab? -> Put notes with date info?
- Slow logging... Log on ram for 24h then save to SD card (Dont burn out SD card)

## Things to Sense / Calculate
- Photos / Image Processing
- Soil Moisture
- Ambient Humiditiy
- Ambient Temperature
- Ambient Light (lux)
- Ambient Pressure (Barometric?)

## PCB V2 Notes
- Use digital pin to wake up sensor (change to 3.3V 555 timer)

## To Order
- RPi 40 pin cable: https://www.digikey.ca/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/1988/7241480
- 5V supply (barallel plug - center postive - double check polarity)
