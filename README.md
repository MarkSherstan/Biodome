# Biodome
Sensor suite and website interface for monitoring plants around the house. Inspired by the Cloud Forest in Singapore.  

## Things to Sense / Calculate
[ ] Photos / Image Processing
[x] Ambient humiditiy
[x] Soil moisture
[x] Temperature
[ ] UV
[x] Pressure (barometric)

## Ideas
- Make my own soil sensor
- Website JavaScript interface (similar to Octo-Print)
- Each plant have its own tab? -> Put notes with date info?
- Slow logging... Dont burn out SD card
- Use digital pin to wake up sensor (change to 3.3V 555 timer)
- Double check barallel jack polarity

Traces on both sides?
Mounting holes?
Add silk screen of roots
